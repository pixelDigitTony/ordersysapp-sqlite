# ordersysapp-sqlite
Developed an android application using JAVA through Android Studio with only SQLite as database, it can run without the need for internet. The app is a simple ordering system in which the user can order items in the menu, cart, and see the order placed on the order list, as well as the items ordered in it. The app focuses on the customer side only, there is none yet for the staff side.</br></br>
For a quick test of the app, just get the apk at "/app/release" directory or folder </br></br>
